    /// Handles transitions between a weapon's various states.
    ///
    /// If the state is anything other than Inactive, and there is no current target
    /// (because it is dead, or it has moved out of range, etc.) then the weapon
    /// transitions to Inactive.
    ///
    /// When first created, the weapon has a full clip equal to ClipSize.
    /// 
    /// Inactive
    /// ========
    /// The weapon starts out in the Inactive state.
    /// 
    /// If:
    /// - the weapon is in the Inactive state
    /// - and it has less than a full clip
    /// - and AutoReloadsClip is Yes or ReturnToBase
    /// then it transitions to InactivePendingReload.
    /// 
    /// When the weapon is given a new target, it transitions to the PreAttack state.
    ///
    /// InactivePendingReload
    /// =====================
    /// The weapon remains this state for the duration specified in AutoReloadWhenIdle.
    /// If no new target has been set in this time, it transitions to Reloading.
    /// (For ReturnToBase, does it transition to Reloading only when it reaches its base?)
    /// If the weapon is given a new target while in this state,
    /// it transitions to the PreAttack state.
    ///
    /// PreAttack
    /// =========
    /// The weapon remains in the PreAttack state for the duration specified in PreAttackDelay.
    /// Then it transitions to Firing.
    ///
    /// Firing
    /// ======
    /// When the weapon transitions to the Firing state, it activates each of its weapon effect nuggets.
    /// The weapon will remain in the Firing state for the duration specified in FiringDuration.
    /// After firing, the weapon transitions to IdleAfterFiring.
    ///
    /// IdleAfterFiring
    /// ===============
    /// The weapon waits for the duration specified in IdleAfterFiringDelay.
    /// Then one of several things can happen:
    /// - If the clip is now empty, the weapon transitions to Reloading.
    /// - If PreAttackType = PerShot, the weapon transitions to PreAttack.
    /// - Otherwise, the weapon transitions to BetweenShots.
    ///
    /// BetweenShots
    /// ====================
    /// The weapon waits for the duration specified in CoolDownDelayBetweenShots.
    /// Then it transitions to Firing.
    ///
    /// Reloading
    /// =========
    /// The weapon will remain in the Reloading state for the duration specified in ClipReloadTime.
    /// At the end of this time, the clip will be filled with ClipSize rounds.
    /// Now one of several things can happen:
    /// - If there is no current target, this was an auto-reload, so the weapon transitions to Inactive.
    /// - If PreAttack = PerClip or PerShot, the weapon transitions to PreAttack.
    /// - Otherwise, the weapon transitions to Firing.
