    /// WHT ( Westwood Hierarchy Tree )
    /// A hierarchy tree defines a set of coordinate systems which are connected
    /// hierarchically. The header defines the name, number of pivots, etc.
    /// The pivots chunk will contain a W3dPivotStructs for each node in the
    /// tree.
    /// 
    /// The W3dPivotFixupStruct contains a transform for each MAX coordinate
    /// system and our version of that same coordinate system (bone). It is 
    /// needed when the user exports the base pose using "Translation Only".
    /// These are the matrices which go from the MAX rotated coordinate systems
    /// to a system which is unrotated in the base pose .These transformations
    /// are needed when exporting a hierarchy animation with the given hierarchy
    /// tree file.
    /// 
    /// Another explanation of these kludgy "fixup" matrices:
    /// 
    /// What are the "fixup" matrices? These are the transforms which
    /// were applied to the base pose when the user wanted to force the
    /// base pose to use only matrices with certain properties. For
    /// example, if we wanted the base pose to use translations only,
    /// the fixup transform for each node is a transform which when
    /// multiplied by the real node's world transform, yeilds a pure
    /// translation matrix. Fixup matrices are used in the mesh
    /// exporter since all vertices must be transformed by their inverses
    /// in order to make things work. They also show up in the animation
    /// exporter because they are needed to make the animation work with
    /// the new base pose.
