## Background

_by Time Jones (2017)_

OpenSAGE is being created by me, Tim Jones. I was at university in February 2003 when C&C Generals was first released. I spent far too much time playing it and the sequel, Zero Hour (and as a consequence, not enough time studying). In my opinion, as a near-real-world RTS game, it is still unmatched even 14 years later.

I later bought The First Decade on DVD, and it was this copy I wanted to install in Windows 10. I even bought an external DVD drive in order to do so. It wasn't straightforward, and it made me worry that one day I won't be able to play what is still my favourite RTS game.

One thing led to another, and I found myself opening `.map` files in a hex viewer. I had the idea of recreating the game, using the original assets. This appealed to me on many levels: it's a preservation of history, it satisfies my nostalgia, and it's an extreme programming challenge.

It's a vast project, and who knows how far I'll get. Hopefully we'll all have some fun along the way.

## Acknowledgements

First, I would like to thank Stephan Vedder ([feliwir](https://github.com/feliwir)) for his efforts, over several years, to understand
several of the key SAGE data formats, including `.w3d`. Without his prior work, I would have had a much harder time getting started.

DeeZire's [module list](http://www.redsys.su/mkportal/files/ModuleList.txt) has been extremely helpful in understanding all the `Object` parameters in `.ini` files.

Finally, I want to thank the original team who built Generals and Zero Hour, because without their work, I wouldn't be doing any of this.
(As I get further into the project, I'm gaining ever greater admiration for what those people were able to achieve 14 years ago, both technically
and artistically.)
